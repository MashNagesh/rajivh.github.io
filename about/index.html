	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Rajiv Hemanth. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Analytics from the National University in Singapore.
	   Mine has been a pretty long and winding path to the field of Data Science - I completed my Bachelors in Computer
	   Science Engineering from the University of Madras way back in 2004. Then did a couple of stints with IT majors. 
	   Work was not great. Kind of followed the herd and did an MBA from IIT Madras. What followed next - IT consulting at
	   a Big 4 firm was not great either. Quit within a year without having any job offers. So you can imagine :-).	
	   
	   Fortunately, I did not have to wait for long and got into a completely new area - Water Sustainability with Biome
	   Environmental Solutions. It was not the same type of work on all days - there was something new to handle quite 
	   often. Worked with plumbers, contractors, interacted with resident welfare associations, house owners, presented 
	   strategies to CXOs of organizations, took water and sanitation literacy lessons for rural Bangalore school kids - 
	   in a nutshell, a pretty diverse work profile. 
	   But then like car   
	   But then like car enthusiasts who get the itch to change their cars periodically, I too got that itch to switch 
	   fields again. And started exploring Analytics, Data Science etc. And now I find myself sitting in class with mates  
	   who were in primary school when I got my first job. It is fun :-). So for people who are on the fence - in a
           dilemma whether they can ditch their uninspiring current work roles to shift to data science, may be I can serve as
	   an inspiration.
	   
	   I hope to invest a lot of time in projects apart from coursework. Currently, working on a chatbot. Next in pipeline                  
           is to make a simple tic tac toe game and make it learn on its own - inspired by Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning   
           Chapter 1. </p>
