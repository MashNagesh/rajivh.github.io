	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Rajiv Hemanth. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Analytics from the National University in Singapore.
	   Mine has been a pretty long and winding path to the field of Data Science - I completed my Bachelors in Computer
	   Science Engineering from the University of Madras way back in 2004. Then did a couple of stints in IT majors like
	   TCS and Mindtree. Work was not great and uninspiring. Kind of followed the herd and did an MBA from IIT Madras.
	   What followed next - IT consulting at KPMG was not great either. Quit within a year without having any job offers.
	   So you can imagine :-). Fortunately, I did not have to wait for long and got into a completely new area - Water
	   Sustainability with Biome Environmental Solutions. It was not the same type of work on all days - there was 	
	   something new to handle quite often. Worked with plumbers, contractors, interacted with resident welfare  
           associations, house owners, presented strategies to CXOs of organizations, took water and sanitation literacy 	    lessons for rural Bangalore school kids - in a nutshell, a pretty diverse work profile. But then like car   
	   enthusiasts who get the itch to change their cars periodically, I too got that itch to switch fields again. And 
	   started exploring Analytics, Data Science etc. And now I find myself sitting in class with mates who were in 	   primary school when I got my first job. It is fun :-). I hope to invest a lot of time in projects apart from 	   coursework. Currently, working on a chatbot. Next in pipeline is to make a simple tic tac toe game and make it 	     learn on its own - inspired by Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning Chapter 1. </p>
