Have been wrestling with NLP, Neural Networks and Tensor Flow for the past few days to make a skeleton of a chat bot - but just could not get my head around all the concepts. So just wanted some instant gratification and saw Suriyadeepan's post about Telegram's bot api. A spark was ignited and I thought of doing something using the slack bot API - I have been using slack for some time now.

Found a very helpful site - https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html - to go about the initial setting up and connections for getting the bot up and running. I must admit that I did get a rush when 'it' replied for the first time - how ever simple it might have been.

Added a little more functionality like giving time and weather details. Would eventually want to train it and make it generate responses.
