Linear Regression can be seen as a way of expressing a linear relationship between two variables (at the simplest level). Now what is a linear relationship - if the relationship between the two variables can be expressed as a straight line, then this qualifies to be a linear relationship. 

Why is this useful - let us consider an example of relation between age and income. We are interested to know if there is a strong relationship between these two variables. The strength of this relationship helps us in being able to predict the variables of interest (income) given a certain set of values of the independent variable (age).

The straight line or linear relationship between the two variables can be expressed in the form:

$$Income = Beta0 + Beta1*Age$$

Here Beta0 is the y-intercept and Beta1 is the slope of the line expressing the relationship between the two variables.

Assuming, we have multiple data points denoting Age and Income, and we plot in the xy space to get a scatter plot.
