Linear Regression can be seen as a way of expressing a linear relationship between two variables (at the simplest level). Now what is a linear relationship - if the relationship between the two variables can be expressed as a straight line, then this qualifies to be a linear relationship. 

Why is this useful - let us consider an example of relation between age and income. We are interested to know if there is a strong relationship between these two variables. The strength of this relationship helps us in being able to predict the variables of interest (income) given a certain set of values of the independent variable (age).

The straight line or linear relationship between the two variables can be expressed in the form:

Income =  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$
