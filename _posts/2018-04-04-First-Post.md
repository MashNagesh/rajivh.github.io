Hello there. Thanks for visiting. Thanks a ton to http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ for the very effective guide on creating a github.io page. While I have been procrastinating doing a blog on my learnings related to data science for a while, this - http://suriyadeepan.github.io - blog triggered me to get going. Thanks to Suriyadeepan as well.

I intend to keep this as a playground for testing my learning. I have realised that putting it down on paper actually reveals what you know and don't know. There might be errors relating to my comprehension - so discretion is advised on the part of the readers :-). Feel free to point out my mistakes.

I hope to keep contributing to this blog periodically - and I hope it helps/ inspires someone/ somewhere.
