Hello there. Thanks for visiting. Thanks a ton to http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ for the very effective guide on creating a github.io page. While I have been procrastinating doing a blog on my learnings related to data science, http://suriyadeepan.github.io - this blog triggered me to get going. Thanks to Suriyadeepan as well.

I hope to keep contributing to this blog periodically - and I hope it helps/ inspires someone/ somewhere.
